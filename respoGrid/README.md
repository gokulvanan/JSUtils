respoGrid
=======


Responsive Grid, inspired and built based on all the grid plugins out there from Footable to YUI, to jqgrid.
One distinct approach is that this grid works as module to plugin to a require.js modular framework.
Just got going about building this for fun and learning.. minimal features.. and lightweight grid framework.
respo grid has a tight coupled dependency on jquery and bootstrap css. 
Focus of the grid is to be resposive to adapt dynamically to any window size.
